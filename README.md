# MangaCollection

MangaCollection is a project developed in SwiftUI and Swift, aimed at manga enthusiasts who wish to organize and track their collection in an intuitive and effective manner. With Firebase for database management and the integration of an external API for manga-related data, the application offers a complete solution for managing manga collections on iOS devices.

## Main Features


* Collection Management: Allows users to keep track of the mangas they own and those they wish to acquire.
* Manga Search: Utilizes an external API to search for detailed information about mangas, making it easier to add to the user's collection.
* Varied Authentication: Offers the possibility to sign up or log in via Apple, Google, or email and password, ensuring secure access.
* Cloud Synchronization: User data is stored and synchronized in real-time with Firebase, allowing access from any device.


## Technologies

* SwiftUI: Used to create a modern and responsive user interface.
* Swift: Programming language for the development of the application.
* Firebase: Real-time database for managing user data.
* External API: For retrieving information and metadata on mangas.

## Note

It's important to emphasize that the development of the application is still in progress. The essential components such as the library, database, API, search features, and authentication are in place and function satisfactorily. However, some adjustments are still needed, and additional features need to be integrated to complete the project.
